# Steps for running the project

1. Ensure `Docker Desktop` is running, and so is the container with the database.
2. Start the backend with `npm run dev` and ensure seeding & connection doesn't fail (otherwise try again)
3. Ensure Expo is connected - go to Powershell as admin and use `zerotier-cli status` to check if online
4. Start the frontend with `npm run start` and ensure backend & frontend are connected
